# CodeReviewer: AI-Powered Code Review Solutions

CodeReviewer offers multiple approaches to AI-powered code review, each with different trade-offs between context comprehension, latency, and code size limitations. This README explains the four available implementations to help you choose the right approach for your needs.

## Approaches

### 1. Chunking Approach

**Implemented in**: `code-reviewer` and deployed at [code-reviewer-liard.vercel.app](https://code-reviewer-liard.vercel.app/)

```
Code → Split into Chunks → Parallel API Requests → Aggregate Responses
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster response time with parallel processing
- Can handle large codebases by breaking them down
- Good for reviewing extensive projects
- Efficiently processes multi-file reviews

**Limitations:**
- Context may be lost between chunks
- May produce inconsistent reviews across chunks
- Each chunk has limited awareness of other code sections
- Aggregating responses can be complex

**Technical Details:**
- Breaks code into manageable chunks based on size and logical boundaries
- Sends each chunk to the AI API in parallel
- Each request includes necessary context about the project
- Responses are parsed and aggregated into a coherent review

**Ideal for:** Large projects where review speed is prioritized over deep contextual understanding.

### 2. Simple Stream Approach

**Implemented in**: `code-reviewer-2` and deployed at [code-reviewer-2.vercel.app](https://code-reviewer-2.vercel.app/)

```
Entire Code (within limits) → Single API Request → Streaming Response
```

**Benefits:**
- Better context retention as the AI sees all code at once
- Simpler implementation
- Streaming provides faster initial feedback
- More consistent review quality

**Limitations:**
- Limited to approximately 700-1000 lines of code
- Not suitable for large codebases
- Longer wait time for initial response on larger files

**Technical Details:**
- Sends the entire codebase in a single request
- Uses streaming API to get incremental responses
- Provides better context awareness for the AI model
- Simpler implementation with less complex aggregation logic

**Ideal for:** Small to medium codebases where comprehensive understanding is important.

### 3. Cache-Based Approach

**Implemented in**: `code-reviewer-2-cache` and deployed at [code-reviewer-2-cache.vercel.app](https://code-reviewer-2-cache.vercel.app/)

```
Code → In-Memory Cache → Process Beyond Time Limits → Final Response
```

**Benefits:**
- No additional server infrastructure required
- Works within Vercel's serverless architecture
- Can bypass the 60-second function execution limit
- Handles medium-sized codebases effectively

**Limitations:**
- Higher latency in production environments
- Performance inconsistencies between dev and production
- Complex caching logic
- Potential reliability issues with cache invalidation

**Technical Details:**
- Uses in-memory caching to preserve state between serverless function invocations
- Implements a polling mechanism to check for completed reviews
- Breaks down the process into smaller steps to fit within time constraints
- Uses clever architecture to work around serverless limitations

**Ideal for:** Medium-sized codebases when you can't deploy additional servers.

### 4. Dedicated Server Approach

**Implemented in**: `code-review-api` with client in `code-reviewer-client` and deployed at [code-reviewer-client.vercel.app](https://code-reviewer-client.vercel.app/)

```
Code → Dedicated API Server → Long-Running AI Process → Response
```

**Benefits:**
- Can process very large codebases
- No time limitations (beyond hosting provider's limits)
- Most robust solution for complex reviews
- Full context awareness across the entire codebase

**Limitations:**
- Requires additional server deployment
- Higher operational costs
- More complex setup and maintenance
- Currently under development with some bugs

**Technical Details:**
- Separate backend service that runs independently of serverless constraints
- Full API for code submission, review processing, and result retrieval
- Designed for production-grade large codebase reviews
- Supports more advanced AI interactions and customizations

**Ideal for:** Production environments with large codebases requiring thorough reviews.

## Implementation Details

Each approach is implemented in its respective directory:

- `code-review-api/`: Backend service for the dedicated server approach
- `code-reviewer/`: Original implementation using the chunking approach
- `code-reviewer-2/`: Improved implementation using the simple streaming approach
- `code-reviewer-2-cache/`: Cache-based implementation for serverless environments
- `code-reviewer-client/`: Frontend client for the dedicated server approach

## Getting Started

1. Choose the approach that best fits your requirements:
   - For small codebases (<1000 lines): Solution 2
   - For medium codebases without additional server: Solution 3
   - For large codebases with speed priority: Solution 1
   - For large codebases with context priority: Solution 4

2. Navigate to the corresponding directory and follow these general steps:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/hamardikan/codeReviewer.git
   cd codeReviewer
   
   # Choose your implementation
   cd code-reviewer-2  # or other implementation
   
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Set up environment variables (see .env.example)
   
   # Run the development server
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Refer to each implementation's specific README for detailed setup instructions

*With reduced context quality

## Use Cases

- **Individual Developers**: Solution 2 (Simple Stream) is ideal for quick reviews of personal projects
- **Small Teams**: Solution 3 (Cache-Based) offers a good balance of capabilities without infrastructure
- **Large Organizations**: Solution 4 (Dedicated Server) provides the most robust solution for enterprise codebases
- **CI/CD Integration**: Solution 1 (Chunking) works well for automated pipeline integration
